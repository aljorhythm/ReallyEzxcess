# ReallyEzxcess

Network from my hostel room was authenticated by a [captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal) called Ezxcess. It frequently disconnected and friends found it a hassle. It wasn't really 'ezxcess'. This program was thus made to routinely check for connectivity to the internet and attempts to sign in if it is not.

## Implementation Description

Ezxcess uses web forms to authenticate. HTTP requests were examined. The program can create HTTP requests using credentials provided by user and sends them to the server.
